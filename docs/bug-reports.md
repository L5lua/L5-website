# Bug Reports

L5 is currently alpha software. Aspects may change between versions, including breaking changes. Not all aspects of the Processing API have been completed, and functionality may be inconsistent or unfinished. 

(Polite!) bug reports can be filed as an [issue](https://github.com/L5lua/L5/issues). Longer communications and feedback about L5 can be sent directly to the author via [email](https://leetusman.com/info/).
