# Bug Reports

L5 is currently pre-alpha software. Large aspects may change between versions, including breaking changes. Not all aspects of the Processing API have been completed, and functionality may be inconsistent or unfinished. 

(Polite!) bug reports can be filed as an issue. Longer communications and feedback about L5 can be sent directly to the author via [email](https://leetusman.com/info/).

Contributions to L5 are welcomed. Before submitting pull requests, please open an issue to discuss proposed changes.
