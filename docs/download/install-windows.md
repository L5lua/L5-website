# Installation on Windows

This tutorial walks you through installing L5 with the Love (Love2d) framework on your Windows computer.

1. Go to the [Love website](https://love2d.org) and click to download the 64-bit zipped Windows program.
2. Your browser may show a warning. Click **"Keep"** or **"Save anyway"** to proceed with the download. It will download to your *Downloads* folder by default.
3. From the L5lua.org Download page, [download the L5 Starter project](/L5-starter.zip).
4. Click **"Save"** when it asks you to save the L5-starter.zip file.
5. Return to your *Downloads* folder on your computer. **Right click** on the Love zip file and choose **"Extract All"**. Click **"Extract"** to extract it to your Downloads folder.
6. Open the extracted Love folder and **double-click** the **love.exe** application to run it. Windows may show a security warning saying "Windows protected your PC". Click **"More info"** and then click **"Run anyway"**.
7. You should see a window open with a flying bird-shaped balloon and clouds, verifying that Love is now properly installed on your computer. **At this point you can close the window.**
8. Back in your downloads folder, **extract the L5-starter.zip file** the same way you extracted the Love zip file. Then **drag the L5-starter folder onto the love.exe application**. It should now launch and you should see a new window open with your code sketch.

**Next steps:** You've installed Love and have L5 on your computer and verified you can run your own programs. Check out [Getting Started](/getting-started) or the [tutorials](index.md) to learn more.
