# Contributing to L5 ❤️

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **L5**! Contributions of all kinds are welcome — from code and documentation to tutorials, examples, and teaching.

We are inspired by the *[all contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors.github.io)* approach to contribution to open source projects:

> Our community values contributions of all forms and seeks to expand the meaning of the word contributor as far and wide as possible. It includes documentation, teaching, writing code, making art, writing, design, activism, organizing, curating, or anything else you might imagine. --*from [p5.js Contributor Guidelines](https://p5js.org/contribute/contributor_guidelines/)*

If you’re new to open source, don’t worry. This guide explains **which repository to use**, **when to fork**, and **how to get started** step by step.

## Step 1: Decide what you want to contribute

L5 has **two main repositories**. Which one you use depends on *what you’re working on*.

### L5 - The library itself 

Use this repository if you want to:

- Fix bugs in the L5 code
- Add or improve features
- Improve core documentation
- Add examples that ship with L5

**Repository:** <https://github.com/L5lua/L5>

### L5 Website - The documentation site

Use this repository if you want to:

- Improve reference pages
- Write or edit tutorials
- Add screenshots or examples
- Improve wording, structure, or beginner explanations

**Repository:** <https://github.com/L5lua/L5-website>


## Step 2: Start with an issue

Before writing code or documentation, we recommend **opening an issue** to describe:

- A bug you found
- A page that’s confusing
- A feature or tutorial idea
- Something you’d like to improve

This helps avoid duplicated work and gives you a place to ask questions.

### Where to file issues

**Library issues:** <https://github.com/L5lua/L5/issues>

**Website issues:** <https://github.com/L5lua/L5-website/issues>


## Step 3: Fork the repository

If you want to make changes:

1. **Fork** the repository you’re contributing to  
   (either `L5` or `L5-website`)
2. Clone **your fork** to your computer
3. Make your changes
4. Open a **Pull Request** back to the main repository

You do **not** need special permission to fork, and you do **not** need to create a branch in the main repository.

Most contributors work directly on the `main` branch of **their fork**.

### Example (command line)

After forking the repo on GitHub, clone *your fork*:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/L5-website.git
cd L5-website
```

Make your changes, then commit and push:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push origin main
```

Finally, open a Pull Request on GitHub from your fork to the main repository.
