It has a straightforward easy-to-learn syntax, accessible for beginners, and it's efficient for experienced programmers as well.</p> <p>The language is lightweight and fast. Despite its small size, there are lots of libraries and it is used in everything from Minecraft's ComputerCraft, to the handheld game device Playdate and the Pico-8 fantasy console, to complex game engines and configuration languages, as well as embedded in many hardware devices. Developing in Lua means your projects can work cross-platform relatively seamlessly, enhancing accessibility and reach.</p> <p>Where Java undergoes regular major updates and JavaScript is a fast-evolving and changing language, Lua is a very slowly and intentionally developed language. It was originally created in Brazil in 1993, and still governed by a goal of including strong backward compatibility during its infrequent but focused updates. For this reason, Lua programs have a high chance of running for years, ideally with little or no changes.</p>"},{"location":"#key-features-of-l5","title":"Key Features of L5","text":"<ul> <li>Lightning fast: Scripts, images, and audio load near-instantly</li> <li>Easy syntax: Easy to learn and consistent syntax.</li> <li>Minimal footprint: L5 (~6MB, from Love2D ~4.5MB + LuaJIT ~1.5MB) vs Processing (~500MB) vs p5.js (~1-4MB + browser ~250-355MB)</li> <li>Lighter impact: Runs on older hardware and devices.</li> <li>Cross-platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Raspberry Pi</li> <li>Synchronous execution: Code runs in predictable order, no async complexity</li> <li>Desktop-focused: Optimized for installations and standalone applications</li> <li>Resiliency: Underlying Lua language and Love2d frameworks change much slower than equivalent languages like JavaScript and Java</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#important-notes","title":"Important Notes","text":"<ul> <li>1-indexed: Lua arrays start at 1, not 0 (use <code>#</code> to get array/string length)</li> <li>2D only: Currently limited to 2D graphics (3D libraries possible but not built-in)</li> <li>Tables everywhere: Lua uses tables for arrays, objects, and data structures</li> <li>OOP patterns: Check Lua documentation for object-oriented programming approaches</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#getting-started","title":"Getting Started","text":"<p>Ready to try L5?

That number is 205.5 plus a random number between 0 and 1, which, results in a decimal (float) between 205.5 and 206.5. When converted to an ASCII character, the fractional (fract) decimal value is automatically removed, with an implicit floor, and the equivalent character <code>'\\'</code> or <code>'/'</code> is printed out. Finally, the program says to goto line number 10 (the beginning of the line), a loop, to begin again, in an infinite loop. This results in a twisty maze of passages created with just these two ASCII characters that spill out over the terminal screen in tumbling lines until the computer operator / programmer interrupts it.</p> <p>Much more can be said about 10print, and in fact, an incredible and widely-lauded 324-page collaboratively-written book also titled 10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); GOTO 10 was published in 2012 by MIT Press. It can be purchased, and is available as a creative-commons licensed book and freely downloadable PDF.</p> <p>And here, following in tradition, we attempt yet another port of the original 10print instruction into somewhat-equivalent functionality with L5. This is but one of many (infinite?) potential implementations, and adds a varying block size each frame. The slow (1 frame per second here) rate is needed as otherwise the redrawing rate would be too quick for our eyes to handle.</p> <p>A main structure in this implementation are nested loops. This classic programming pattern is used everywhere from grid-based and patterned artworks to top down and sidescrolling tiled 2D videogames. The inner loop of incrementing x values advances the blocks across the page all the way to the right, where at that point the y value advances one block down the page, and begins looping through the x values again, drawing to the right, finally stopping drawing one complete iteration of the maze upon reaching the bottom of the window before drawing anew top to bottom again on the successive frame.</p> <p>Ways you can build on the 10print code:</p> <ul> <li>Add color to the maze</li> <li>Alter the randomness percentage to be more likely to draw one kind of line or the other</li> <li>Change the block output to other line forms or shapes to make other kinds of mazes </li> <li>Figure out an implementation that iteratively adds one line per frame rather than drawing the whole maze grid at once</li> <li>Apply more ideas you read about from 10Print and ideas of your own</li> </ul> <p></p> <pre><code>require (\"L5\")\n\nfunction setup()\n  size(600, 800)\n  block = height / 40\n\n  frameRate(1)\n\n  describe(\"A maze of twisty little passages in each frame\")\nend\n\nfunction draw()\n  background(255)\n  block = floor(random(10,140))\n  for y = 1, height, block do\n    for x = 1, width, block do\n      if random() &lt; 0.5 then\n    line(x, y, x + block, y + block)\n      else\n    line(x + block, y, x, y + block)\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"examples/10print/#related-references","title":"Related References","text":"<ul> <li>for</li> <li>floor()</li> <li>frameRate()</li> <li>if</li> <li>line()</li> <li>draw()</li> <li>random()</li> </ul>"},{"location":"examples/10print/#related-examples","title":"Related Examples","text":"<ul> <li>Animation with Events - Pause and resume animation.</li> <li>Basic Pong - A simple program demonstrating a basic implementation of pong with enemy AI player</li> <li>Conditions - Use if and else statements to make decisions while your sketch runs.</li> <li>Copy Image Data - Paint from an image file onto the canvas.</li> <li>Conway's Game Of Life - An implementation of the zero-player game and simulation formulated by mathematician John Conway</li> <li>Minimum Spanning Tree - An example of implementing Prim's algorithm for finding the shortest lengths to connect all randomly placed dots</li> <li>Walking lines - Visualizes randomly drawn lines bouncing around a box with their intersecting points highlighted</li> </ul>"},{"location":"examples/animation-and-variables-animation-with-events/","title":"Animation with Events","text":"<p>This example demonstrates the use of loop() and noLoop() to pause and resume the animation.</p> <p>Clicking the mouse toggles the animation loop.

For that we have the createGraphics() function.</p> <p>In this example, a type of drawing program, dragging with the mouse across the window will draw tiny photos wherever our mouse is located. If this was the entirety of the program, we'd have no need for createGraphics. A minimal implementation of this follows:</p> <pre><code>require(\"L5\")\n\nfunction setup()\n  -- initalize a global array of images\n  img = {}\n\n  -- load all of our images\n  for i=1,9 do\n    img[i] = loadImage(\"assets/\"..i..\".png\")\n  end\n\n  describe(\"Draws random images at mouse position when dragged in the window.\")\nend\n\nfunction mouseDragged()\n  image(random(img),mouseX, mouseY, 50, 50)\nend\n</code></pre> <p>This program is fine, but what happens if we want a new color background each time we press down to draw a line or lay down photos? If we added <code>background()</code> to the <code>mouseDragged()</code> function than we would cover all of our previous drawing. To prevent this problem, we use an offscreen canvas. </p> <p>In our <code>setup()</code> we load in photos to an array <code>img</code>. And we initialize our <code>offscreenCanvas</code> as a new graphics buffer for drawing with <code>createGraphics()</code>. </p> <p>As draw runs continously, it grabs the offscreen canvas. We'll come back to that. In the mouseDragged event, as long as we are dragging the mouse we start drawing to the offscreen buffer, leaving a randomly-selected image at the equivalent of the mouse X and Y positions, but in the offscreen canvas. As we press down on the mouse, we draw a random color on the entire visible fullscreen. Then in draw, we take the offscreen graphics canvas and draw it as an image, starting at the top left 0, 0 position, effectively applying this offscreen doodle of images with transparent background on top of the color background. This allows us to maintain the design of drawing photos on a colored canvas without overwriting the entire window's contents.</p> <p>To extend the program, try changing the images, creating buttons to select images to draw with, add a secret scratch-off image finder or turn it into a coloring book game.

For example, a <code>for</code> loop makes it easy to express the idea \"draw five lines\" like so:</p> <pre><code>for x = 10,100,20 do\n  line(x, 25, x, 75)\nend\n</code></pre> <p>The loop's header begins with the keyword <code>for</code>. Loops generally count up or count down as they repeat, or iterate. The statements in parentheses <code>x = 10, 100, 20</code> tell the loop how it should repeat:</p> <ul> <li><code>x = 10</code> tells the loop to start counting at <code>10</code> and keep track of iterations using the variable <code>x</code>.</li> <li><code>100</code> tells the loop to count up to <code>100</code>, inclusive (note: Unlike Lua, both Java and Javascript treat the stop value as exclusive.)</li> <li><code>20</code>  tells the loop to count up by <code>20</code> at the end of each iteration.</li> </ul> <p>The code following <code>do</code> until <code>end</code> is the loop's body. Statements in the loop body are repeated during each iteration of the loop.</p> <p><code>for</code> loops can also count down:</p> <pre><code>for d = 100,0,-10 do\n  circle(50, 50, d)\nend\n</code></pre> <p><code>for</code> loops can also contain other loops. The following nested loop draws a grid of points:</p> <pre><code>-- Loop from left to right.\nfor x = 10,100,10 do\n\n  -- Loop from top to bottom.\n  for y = 10,100,10 do\n    point(x, y)\n  end\n\nend\n</code></pre> <p><code>for</code> loops are also helpful for iterating through the elements of an array. For example, it's common to iterate through an array that contains information about where or what to draw:</p> <pre><code>--Create an ordered table array of x-coordinates.\nlocal xCoordinates = {20, 40, 60}\n\nfor i = 1,#xCoordinates do\n  -- Update the element.\n  xCoordinates[i] = xCoordinates[i] + random(-1, 1)\n\n  -- Draw a circle.\n  circle(xCoordinates[i], 50, 20)\nend\n</code></pre> <p>If the array's values aren't modified, the <code>for...of</code> statement can simplify the code. They're similar to <code>for...in</code> loops in JavaScript, <code>for</code> loops in Python and <code>for-each</code> loops in C++ and Java. The following loops have the same effect:</p> <pre><code>-- Draw circles with a for loop.\nlocal xCoordinates = {20, 40, 60}\n\nfor i = 1,#xCoordinates do\n  circle(xCoordinates[i], 50, 20);\nend\n</code></pre> <pre><code>-- Draw circles with a for...in loop.\nlocal xCoordinates = {20, 40, 60}\n\nfor i,x in ipairs(xCoordinates) do\n  circle(x, 50, 20);\nend\n</code></pre> <p>In the code snippets above, the variables <code>i</code> and <code>x</code> have different roles.</p> <p>In the first snippet, <code>i</code> counts from <code>1</code> up to <code>3</code>, which is the length of <code>xCoordinates</code>, which we can get with prepending # to <code>#xCoordinates</code>. <code>i</code> is used to access the element in <code>xCoordinates</code> at index <code>i</code>.</p> <p>In the second code snippet using Lua's function <code>ipairs()</code>, <code>x</code> isn't keeping track of the loop's progress or an index. During each iteration, <code>x</code> contains the next element of <code>xCoordinates</code>. <code>x</code> starts from the beginning of <code>xCoordinates</code> (<code>20</code>) and updates its value to <code>40</code> and then <code>60</code> during the next iterations.</p>"},{"location":"reference/for/#examples","title":"Examples","text":"<pre><code>require(\"L5\")\n\nfunction setup()\n  size(100, 100)\n\n  describe('Five black vertical lines on a gray background.')\nend\n\nfunction draw()\n  background(200)\n\n  -- Draw vertical lines using a loop.\n  for x=10,100,20 do\n    line(x, 25, x, 75)\n  end\nend\n</code></pre> <pre><code>require(\"L5\")\n\nfunction setup()\n  size(100, 100)\n\n  describe('Five white concentric circles drawn on a gray background.')\nend\n\nfunction draw()\n  background(200)\n\n  -- Draw concentric circles using a loop.\n  for d = 100,0,-20 do\n    circle(50, 50, d)\n  end\nend\n</code></pre> <pre><code>require(\"L5\")\n\nfunction setup()\n  size(100, 100)\n\n  describe('A grid of black dots on a gray background.')\nend\n\nfunction draw()\n  background(200)\n\n  -- Set the spacing for points on the grid.\n  local space = 10\n\n  -- Increase the stroke weight.\n  strokeWeight(3)\n\n  -- Loop from the left to the right.\n  for x=space,100-1,space do\n    -- Loop from the top to the bottom.\n    for y=space,100-1,space do\n      point(x, y)\n    end\n  end\nend\n</code></pre> <pre><code>-- Declare the variable xCoordinates and assign it an array of numbers.\nlocal xCoordinates = {20, 40, 60, 80}\n\nrequire(\"L5\")\n\nfunction setup()\n  size(100, 100)\n\n  describe('Four white circles drawn in a horizontal line on a gray background.')\nend\n\nfunction draw()\n  background(200)\n\n  -- Access the element at index i and use it to draw a circle.\n  for i=1,#xCoordinates do\n    circle(xCoordinates[i], 50, 20)\n  end\nend\n</code></pre> <pre><code>-- Declare the variable xCoordinates and assign it an array of numbers.\nlocal xCoordinates = {20, 40, 60, 80}\n\nrequire(\"L5\")\n\nfunction setup()\n  size(100, 100)\n\n  describe('Four white circles drawn in a horizontal line on a gray background.')\nend\n\nfunction draw()\n  background(200)\n\n  -- Access each element of the array and use it to draw a circle.\n  for _,x in ipairs(xCoordinates) do\n    circle(x, 50, 20)\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"reference/for/#related","title":"Related","text":"<ul> <li>function</li> <li>table</li> <li>while</li> </ul> <p>This reference page contains content adapted from p5.js and Processing by p5.js Contributors and Processing Foundation, licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.</p>"},{"location":"reference/fract/","title":"fract()","text":"<p>Calculates the fractional part of a number.</p> <p>A number's fractional part includes its decimal values.

The <code>push()</code> and pop() functions can limit the effect of transformations to a specific group of shapes, images, and text.

They're like if statements that repeat. For example, a <code>while</code> loop makes it easy to express the idea \"draw several lines\" like so:</p> <pre><code>-- Declare a variable to keep track of iteration\nlocal x = 10\n\n-- Repeat as long as x &lt; 100\nwhile x &lt; 100 do\n  line(x, 25, x, 75)\n\n  -- Increment by 20.\n  x = x + 20\nend\n</code></pre> <p>The loop's header begins with the keyword <code>while</code>. Loops generally count up or count down as they repeat, or iterate. The statement in parentheses <code>x &lt; 100</code> is a condition the loop checks each time it iterates. If the condition is <code>true</code>, the loop runs the code between the <code>do</code> and <code>end</code>. The code between these is called the loop's body. If the condition is <code>false</code>, the body is skipped and the loop is stopped.</p> <p>It's common to create infinite loops accidentally. For example, the following loop never stops iterating because it doesn't count up (warning: it could also crash your computer!):</p> <pre><code>-- Declare a variable to keep track of iteration.\n-- Running this code could crash your computer\nlocal x = 10\n\n-- Repeat as long as x &lt; 100\nwhile x &lt; 100 do \n  line(x, 25, x, 75)\nend\n\n-- This should be in the loop's body!\nx = x + 20\n</code></pre> <p>The statement <code>x = x + 20</code> appears after the loop's body. That means the variable <code>x</code> is stuck at <code>10</code>,  which is always less than <code>100</code>.</p> <p><code>while</code> loops are useful when the number of iterations isn't known in advance. For example, concentric circles could be drawn at random increments:</p> <pre><code>local d = 100\nlocal minSize = 5\n\nwhile d &gt; minSize do\n  circle(50, 50, d)\n  d = d - random(10)\nend\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"reference/while/#examples","title":"Examples","text":"<pre><code>require(\"L5\")\n\nfunction setup()\n  size(100, 100)\n\n  describe('Five black vertical lines on a gray background.')\nend\n\nfunction draw()\n  background(200)\n\n  -- Declare a variable to keep track of iteration.\n  local x = 10\n\n  -- Repeat as long as x &lt; 100\n  while x &lt; 100 do\n    line(x, 25, x, 75)\n\n    -- Increment by 20.\n    x = x + 20\n  end\nend\n\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"reference/while/#related","title":"Related","text":"<ul> <li>for</li> <li>function</li> <li>if</li> </ul> <p>This reference page contains content adapted from p5.js and Processing by p5.js Contributors and Processing Foundation, licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.</p>"},{"location":"reference/width/","title":"width","text":"<p>A <code>Number</code> variable that stores the width of the canvas in pixels.</p> <p><code>width</code>'s default value is 100.

Then we'll end the setup section with the word <code>end</code> on the last line.</p> <pre><code>  ellipse(50, 50, 80, 80)\n</code></pre> <p>This line of code means \"draw an ellipse, with the center 50 pixels over from the left and 50 pixels down from the top, with a width and height of 80 pixels.\" Incidentally, the space before the word ellipse is optional, and will have no impact on your program, but it's a custom that programmers use to make their code inside the setup function (for example) easier to read. It's also common to skip lines before and after functions, which again has no impact on how your program's output when it runs.</p> <p>After entering all this code save your <code>main.lua</code>. Then drop the folder holding your project's main.lua and L5.lua files onto the Love2d applicaton icon. </p> <p>If you've typed everything correctly, you'll see a circle on your screen. If you only see a black screen, you forgot to include the line <code>require(\"L5\")</code> at the top of your main.lua file. If you didn't type something correctly, the window will turn blue and in white text complain about an error. If this happens, make sure that you've copied the example code exactly: the ellipse's numbers should be contained within parentheses and have commas between each of them. Check your spelling of function, setup(), ellipse and end!</p> <p>One of the most difficult things about getting started with programming is that you have to be very specific about the syntax, the way you write code. Our coding software isn't always smart enough to know what you mean, and can be quite fussy about the placement of punctuation. You'll get used to it with a little practice.</p> <p>Next, we'll skip ahead to a sketch that's a little more exciting. Delete the text from the last example, and try this:</p> <p></p> <pre><code>require(\"L5\")\n\nfunction setup()\n  size(480, 120)\nend\n\nfunction draw()\n  if mouseIsPressed then\n    fill('black')\n  else\n    fill('white')\n  end\n  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 80, 80)\nend\n</code></pre> <p>This program creates a window that is 480 pixels wide and 120 pixels high, and then starts drawing white circles at the position of the mouse. When a mouse button is pressed, the circle color changes to black. We'll explain more about the elements of this program in detail later. For now, run the code, move the mouse, and click to see what it does. When you are finished, quit or close your program window.</p> <p>It\u2019s always a good idea to save your code sketches often. As you try different things, keep saving with different names, so that you can always go back to an earlier version. This is especially helpful if\u2014no, when\u2014something breaks. </p> <p>To create a new sketch, you'll need a new independent project folder, with its own L5.lua and main.lua inside.A simple way to do this would be to duplicate your previous folder, which you can do easily by copying and pasting the previous folder, and then renaming the new one.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/first-steps/#examples-and-reference","title":"Examples and Reference","text":"<p>Learning how to program involves exploring lots of code: running, altering, breaking, and enhancing it until you have reshaped it into something new.

There are 2 reasons you may want to favor using an external program to encode your video:</p> <ul> <li>Some programs such as Blender can render to Ogg Theora. However, the default quality presets are usually very low by today's standards. You may be able to increase the quality options in the software you're using, but you may find the output quality to remain less than ideal (given the increased file size). This usually means that the software only supports encoding to constant bit rate (CBR), instead of variable bit rate (VBR). VBR encoding should be preferred in most scenarios as it provides a better quality to file size ratio.</li> <li>Some other programs can't render to Ogg Theora at all.</li> </ul> <p>In this case, you can render the video to an intermediate high-quality format (such as a high-bitrate H.264 video) then re-encode it to Ogg Theora. Ideally, you should use a lossless or uncompressed format as an intermediate format to maximize the quality of the output Ogg Theora video, but this can require a lot of disk space.</p> <p>FFmpeg (CLI) is a popular open source tool for this purpose. FFmpeg has a steep learning curve, but it's a powerful tool.</p> <p>Here are example FFmpeg commands to convert an MP4 video to Ogg Theora. Since FFmpeg supports a lot of input formats, you should be able to use the commands below with almost any input video format (AVI, MOV, WebM, \u2026).</p> <p>Note: Make sure your copy of FFmpeg is compiled with libtheora and libvorbis support. You can check this by running <code>ffmpeg</code> without any arguments, then looking at the <code>configuration:</code> line in the command output.</p> <p>Warning: Current official FFmpeg releases have some bugs in their Ogg/Theora multiplexer. It's highly recommended to use one of the latest static daily builds, or build from their master branch to get the latest fixes.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/video/#balancing-quality-and-file-size","title":"Balancing quality and file size","text":"<p>The video quality level (<code>-q:v</code>) must be between <code>1</code> and <code>10</code>. Quality <code>6</code> is a good compromise between quality and file size. If encoding at a high resolution (such as 1440p or 4K), you will probably want to decrease <code>-q:v</code> to <code>5</code> to keep file sizes reasonable. Since pixel density is higher on a 1440p or 4K video, lower quality presets at higher resolutions will look as good or better compared to low-resolution videos.</p> <p>The audio quality level (<code>-q:a</code>) must be between <code>-1</code> and <code>10</code>. Quality <code>6</code> provides a good compromise between quality and file size. In contrast to video quality, increasing audio quality doesn't increase the output file size nearly as much. Therefore, if you want the cleanest audio possible, you can increase this to 9 to get perceptually lossless audio. This is especially valuable if your input file already uses lossy audio compression. Higher quality audio does increase the CPU usage of the decoder, so it might lead to audio dropouts in case of high system load. See this page for a table listing Ogg Vorbis audio quality presets and their respective variable bitrates.</p> <p>The GOP (Group of Pictures) size (<code>-g:v</code>) is the max interval between keyframes. Increasing this value can improve compression with almost no impact on quality. The default size (<code>12</code>) is too low for most types of content, it's therefore recommended using higher GOP values before reducing video quality. Compression benefits will fade away as the GOP size increases though. Values between <code>64</code> and <code>512</code> usually give the best compression.</p> <p>Note: Higher GOP sizes will increase max seek times with a sudden increase when going beyond powers of two starting at <code>64</code>.
